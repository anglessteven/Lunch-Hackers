# Lunch-Hackers

# Summary

Every two weeks, we will have a few problems that the group will try to solve. After the two weeks are up (technically on a Friday evening), we will schedule a weekend video call at some time that is convenient for everyone who has submitted a solution (hopefully this will settle into a particular time with some regularity).

Each week's problems will be listed in this repo.

To get added to our private list of people for the video call, just open an issue here and we will get you on it.

# Get Started
1. Fork this repository.

1. The directory structure should be fairly self explanatory — challenge/author/code

1. Create a pull request into [this repository](https://github.com/anglessteven/Lunch-Hackers) when you've solved a challenge. This will facilitate review of the challenge by others. We have centered around Steven's repo to avoid hunting around to find each others' code.

1. Sign up on HackerRank so that you can submit your solutions and verify they’re right. _(optional)_

## Challenges:
Each week there are some number of challenges, do as many as you feel comfortable doing.
